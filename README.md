# Final Project
## Ideas
- Gym OpenAI game modeling (https://gym.openai.com)
- Genetic Algorithm for Path Finding


### Balancing Algorithm
- https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/
- Algorithms: 
  - Brute force
    - "if going to the right, push to the left"
  - reinforcement learning
    - Neuroevolution
      - This can be easily implemented with tf.layers
    - Q learning
      - Would be much harder to implement but would be a good learning experience
  - digital negative feedback loop (like what would be in control theory)


1) Make base program for interacting with the cartpole environment
2) Make all of the algorithms that will interface with the cartpole algorithm
3) compare and contrast the algorithms
  - how long the pole balances
  - maximum angle that the pole reaches (smaller better) stability
  - 
4) Graph all of the performance results
5) include a GIF of each of the balancing algorithms
