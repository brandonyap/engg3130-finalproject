# Final Project
## Ideas
- Gym OpenAI game modeling (https://gym.openai.com)
- Genetic Algorithm for Path Finding


### Balancing Algorithm
- https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/
- Algorithms: 
  - Brute force
    - "if going to the right, push to the left"
  - reinforcement learning
    - Neuroevolution
      - This can be easily implemented with tf.layers
    - Q learning
      - Would be much harder to implement but would be a good learning experience
  - digital negative feedback loop (like what would be in control theory)
